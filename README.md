# Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict Bitcoin price trends. The goal is to develop a model that can predict whether buying Bitcoin at a certain time would be profitable.

## Libraries Used:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `sklearn` for machine learning algorithms
- `xgboost` for improved predictive performance

## Dataset
The dataset contains Bitcoin price data from July 2014 to December 2022, with the following columns:
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume
- Market Cap
